Kate Smith	2012-11-05	Awesome user-interface!
Geng	2012-11-05	Extremely quick and efficient. Great for renaming anime too - I was very impressed at FileBot's ability to consistently rename anime using AniDB. A must for keeping a large collection clean!
Akya	2013-02-21	Extremely efficient, especially for renaming single episodes.

William Danis	2013-06-18	FileBot is excellent! Thanks.
Hayward	2013-08-08	Wow! Thank you so much for this program. I had a large collection of tv shows which I was not looking forward to sorting out. Dumped the files into FileBot and within minutes, all done.Even finds the correct name within filenames with a load of junk in them.
Raydan	2013-09-08	I can really recommend using filebot for sorting, moving, deleting, subtitle searching... I just started the script once... and it was quite mindblowing to be honest.
Nitish Kumar	2013-09-21	FileBot is such an amazing piece of work. Been using it for TV Show renaming but today I tried it on movies as well. Big time success!
Mitch Franklin	2013-11-17	Absolutely brilliant application. Does everything so smoothly!
Alexander Walter	2013-12-12	Loving FileBot. I only wish I had discovered it sooner. Thank you for saving me so much time!
Saul Chernick	2013-12-25	This is an amazing, amazing open-source project and deserves much success.
Sic	2014-03-07	I am a heavy XBMC user and I have tested many renaming programs and I have to admit yours just rocks. I virtually have 100% success rate in scraping.
Chuck	2014-04-08	It will rip through movies and tv series files like a knife through butter.
Piers	2014-04-16	I would go with FileBot to rename content - over 18,000 files and a 99.8% first time success rate.
Joe Cal	2014-07-31	Filebot is probably one of the top 5 computer programs I've ever used.
Brony	2014-09-01	Seriously one of the most useful apps on my Mac.
Jeff Racer	2015-02-11	This app has saved me thousands of hours.
Christian Horch	2015-04-14	This is a new level and the ease of use is amazing!!!
Resonance	2015-06-12	Filebot renamed seasons worth of episodes in just a second, exactly the way I needed it for Plex Media Server. The design and execution of this software is excellent. If you are using Plex, or thinking about buying Plex, you absolutely must have this software.
digitaladdictions	2015-08-31	Worth every penny and then some! I can't even start to fathom how much time and mind numbing tedium FileBot has saved me.
Barry	2015-11-06	Filebot is the best software out there. For organizing TV Shows it is indispensable as far as I am concerned. I don't know what more I can say except that is simple to use and works every time.
