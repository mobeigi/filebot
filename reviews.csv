OpenID User;2012-11-05;Extremely quick and efficient. Great for renaming anime, too - I was very impressed at Filebot's ability to consistently rename anime using AniDB. A must for keeping a large collection clean!

williamdanis;2013-06-18;Filebot is excellent! Thanks.
haywardb;2013-08-08;Wow, thank you so much for this program. I had a large collection of tv shows which I was not looking forward to sorting out. Dumped the files into FileBot and within minutes, all done. Even finds correct name within filenames with a load of junk in them.
Raydan;2013-09-08;I can really recommend using filebot for sorting, moving, deleting, subtitle searching... I just started the script once... and it was quite mindblowing to be honest.
Nitish Kumar;2013-09-21;FileBot is such an amazing piece of work. Been using it for TV Shows renaming but today tried over movies as well. Big time success!
mitchfranklin;2013-11-17;Absolutely brilliant application. Does everything so smoothly!
Alexander Walter;2013-12-12;Loving FileBot. I only wish I had discovered it sooner. Thank you for saving me so much time.
Saul Chernick;2013-12-25;This is an amazing, amazing open-source project and deserves much success.
