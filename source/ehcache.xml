    CacheManager Configuration
    ==========================
    An ehcache.xml corresponds to a single CacheManager.
    
    See instructions below or the ehcache schema (ehcache.xsd) on how to configure.

    System property tokens can be specified in this file which are replaced when the configuration
    is loaded. For example multicastGroupPort=${multicastGroupPort} can be replaced with the
    System property either from an environment variable or a system property specified with a
    command line switch such as -DmulticastGroupPort=4446.

    DiskStore configuration
    =======================

    The diskStore element is optional. To turn off disk store path creation, comment out the diskStore
    element below.

    Configure it if you have overflowToDisk or diskPersistent enabled for any cache.

    If it is not configured, and a cache is created which requires a disk store, a warning will be
     issued and java.io.tmpdir will automatically be used.

    diskStore has only one attribute - "path". It is the path to the directory where
    .data and .index files will be created.

    If the path is one of the following Java System Property it is replaced by its value in the
    running VM. For backward compatibility these are not specified without being enclosed in the ${token}
    replacement syntax.

    The following properties are translated:
    * user.home - User's home directory
    * user.dir - User's current working directory
    * java.io.tmpdir - Default temp file path
    * ehcache.disk.store.dir - A system property you would normally specify on the command line
      e.g. java -Dehcache.disk.store.dir=/u01/myapp/diskdir ...

    Subdirectories can be specified below the property e.g. java.io.tmpdir/one
    -->
    <diskStore path="java.io.tmpdir/filebot-cache" />
    
    <!--
    Cache configuration
    ===================

    The following attributes are required.

    name:
    Sets the name of the cache. This is used to identify the cache. It must be unique.

    maxElementsInMemory:
    Sets the maximum number of objects that will be created in memory

	maxElementsOnDisk:
    Sets the maximum number of objects that will be maintained in the DiskStore
	The default value is zero, meaning unlimited.

    eternal:
    Sets whether elements are eternal. If eternal,  timeouts are ignored and the
    element is never expired.

    overflowToDisk:
    Sets whether elements can overflow to disk when the memory store
    has reached the maxInMemory limit.

    The following attributes and elements are optional.

    timeToIdleSeconds:
    Sets the time to idle for an element before it expires.
    i.e. The maximum amount of time between accesses before an element expires
    Is only used if the element is not eternal.
    Optional attribute. A value of 0 means that an Element can idle for infinity.
    The default value is 0.

    timeToLiveSeconds:
    Sets the time to live for an element before it expires.
    i.e. The maximum time between creation time and when an element expires.
    Is only used if the element is not eternal.
    Optional attribute. A value of 0 means that and Element can live for infinity.
    The default value is 0.

    diskPersistent:
    Whether the disk store persists between restarts of the Virtual Machine.
    The default value is false.

    diskExpiryThreadIntervalSeconds:
    The number of seconds between runs of the disk expiry thread. The default value
    is 120 seconds.

    diskSpoolBufferSizeMB:
    This is the size to allocate the DiskStore for a spool buffer. Writes are made
    to this area and then asynchronously written to disk. The default size is 30MB.
    Each spool buffer is used only by its cache. If you get OutOfMemory errors consider
    lowering this value. To improve DiskStore performance consider increasing it. Trace level
    logging in the DiskStore will show if put back ups are occurring. 

    memoryStoreEvictionPolicy:
    Policy would be enforced upon reaching the maxElementsInMemory limit. Default
    policy is Least Recently Used (specified as LRU). Other policies available -
    First In First Out (specified as FIFO) and Less Frequently Used
    (specified as LFU)
